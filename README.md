# Tumor Segmentation using Transfer Learning 🧠🧬

This project applies **transfer learning** techniques for **brain tumor segmentation** from MRI scans. Using medical imaging libraries and the FastAI framework, the project demonstrates how to preprocess MRI data, build a segmentation model, and evaluate its performance.

## 📌 Project Highlights

* **Objective**: Automate tumor segmentation from brain MRI images using deep learning.
* **Methodology**: Utilizes FastAI's high-level API with pre-trained CNN architectures.
* **Data Format**: Medical imaging data in `.nii` (NIfTI) format.
* **Tools Used**: FastAI, PyTorch, OpenCV, NiBabel, and ImageIO.



## 📂 Dataset

* MRI scans are stored in the `dataset/` directory.
* Each scan is in NIfTI format (`.nii`) and contains 3D volumetric data.

> Note: The dataset must be downloaded separately and placed in the appropriate folder as the `.ipynb` file expects a local path.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download and extract the dataset into the `dataset/` folder.
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook tumor-segmentation-using-transfer-learning.ipynb
```

3. Run all cells to:

   * Preprocess and visualize the images.
   * Prepare training and validation datasets.
   * Train the segmentation model using transfer learning.
   * Evaluate predictions.

## 📊 Model and Results

* The model uses **UNet** architecture with a pre-trained encoder backbone.
* Evaluation includes visual inspection of predicted segmentation masks overlaid on MRI slices.
* Loss function: Dice Loss or CrossEntropy (depending on configuration).
* Metrics: Dice coefficient, Accuracy.

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes:

* Slices of original MRI volumes
* Ground truth masks
* Predicted masks (overlayed)
* Loss curves and accuracy plots

## 🔍 Future Work

* Implement cross-validation for robustness.
* Experiment with different pre-trained backbones (e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet).
* Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask for clinical demonstration.
